Chrome Built-in AI Challenge-2025, a anti-procrastination companion


I have joined chrome AI challenge 2025 to build a web applivcation using the chrome extensions and API (checek the rules on site)

The goal of what i wish to achieve is a anti procrastination AI companion that has some variety of features - called Aeryth

features that i wish to build with it:- an AI UI structure similar to the famous AI for comfortaility (already finished), Currently Phase two has been finished ut i have some changes to make before moving to phase 3 (the phases are clearly mentioned in the attached image)

So please note my changes for also the future phases 

 1. the explore or set goal is where a user starts a new chat ( a new chat when clicked by default opens explore mode) 

 the explore mode is where the user learns about and thinks of what they decide to do - so the AI is not going to start asking them to do some work before they understand the topics 

 2.Once they have explored enough they can set goal under that chat meaning the goal is linked to this chat which is their routine- when this is done their routine is mapped to calendar with the days and time recorded in it like a google calendar (which the user can open if required), the calendar option is available in the side bar at the right side (phase 4)

 3.Change the text in the following : in setting set up - change  Nagging criteria (the stop switch) to Routine criteria (only the text should be changed),in aeryth's tone remove the Manipulator term from Friendly manipulatore and make it as Friendly (default)

3.5- under the "Next Routine" area inside the sidebar of aeryth it should display the next two routines that is within the next 8 hours 



 4. the history of chats which was previously called All routines in the sidebar will be renamed to Routines and under that will be the chats of the previous explore chats unless they have deleted it 

 5. also the delete button is available for each chat which is inside the three dots at the end of the that name (similar to any AI structure) 

 6. If by chance any two routine times overlap then the set goal option is temporarily saved but returns to the explore chat of the respective set goal and say that you already have 'xx' fixed on that time so change time

7. Out of the three options - when explore is clciked- it opens a new chat once user enters any text (similar to the New chat button which should be added above the serach bar in the sidebar (below the aeryth name and above the search bar),

when set goal is clicked - it opens the tab as it is doing now and after setting the goal the time and days are registered in calendar and the routine is mapped to the current explore chat they were using for further chats and reminders and this chat is saved under the Routines (Previously All routines) like the AI saves the topic of what we chat, it has rename and delet options- so each chat is connected to a explore,set goal, and a calendar routine - making them each as a single routine chat - so when the chat topic is deletd it is removed from calendar (hence should give a warning message similar to Do you completely want to remove this goal)

Finally the third is diary which is a new chat per day - this chat is stored in backend and the summarized version is used by the AI for the report progress and tracking user 

8. I have a lot more to change on the AIs tone settings- as far as i checked the current canvas code- it is using the about you filled by the user too frequently saying that you told you are like this in each message and that is why its reply is that way- I do not want the AI to delibrately say their about status to them since this is something they feel guilty and already know, instead it should use this to find the user personality and train itself relative to that and reply the user accordingly.
